Takes a graph from standard input and outputs the 
minimum spanning forest (union of all MSTs of its
connected components if the graph is not 
connected.) Input is given in the form described 
by the psuedo-EBNF:

input ::= <num_verticies> <num_edges> {<edge>}
edge ::= <vertex1> <vertex2> <weight>

Output is given in an xml format that describes
the roads in the minimum spanning forest.
